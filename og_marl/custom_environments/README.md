# NOTE ON CUSTOM ENVIRONMENT CODE

This directory contains the custom environment code used by several works in the literature.

We believe researchers should avoid using custom environment code. And should instead use the
standard environment implementations by the original creators of the environment.
However, for ease of comparison with prior works, we include the custom environment code here.
